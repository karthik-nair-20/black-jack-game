    <h1>How to play</h1>
    <p>the objective of the game is to get a set of cards in which the sum must be 21. Or you can get as close as possible without bursting</p>
    <br />
    <p>if you go over 21, you lose, if the dealer has 21 or less and you have less points than the dealer, you lose.</p>
    <br>
    <p>the numbered cards correspond to their respective value.</p>
    <br>
    <p>the cards with letters, the situation changes a little, J, Q and K cards are worth 10 points</p>
    <br>
    <p>but "A" card has a value of 1.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Hit and Stay</h2>
    <br>
    <p>when you start the game, you will decide if you want more cards, or if you want to keep the amount you received.</p>
    <br>
    <p>but, if you still haven't exceeded, a timer will appear for you to play in up to 6 seconds, if you don't do anything, you will lose your turn (stay).</p>
